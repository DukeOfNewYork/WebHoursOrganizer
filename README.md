# WebHoursOrganizer
A JS based program that lets you manually enter hours and auto calculate hours around it

Example at https://jsfiddle.net/DukeOfNewYorkA1/s7ch5xeh/

This program evenly divides up hours into 15 minute chunks and adds any non-even hours to the designated "Prefered Day." It also accepts custom hours and will build the week around that. Also it prevents dublicate names and instead updates the already exsisting name.
